<Sam>   Start thinking about the routing as it's laid out on the navbars:   
            <!>
            HomePage: Should be curated content by user. How can we implement that? Only posts from liked users? Or a fizz-buzz type thing, and display one random post every 3rd?
            Posts page: Can we query all posts by session user_id? Then display, and have the update post paths through that screen.
            Friends page: Display all friends by id, and implement a search by name? This would also route from the search bar on the right-nav.</!>

            Do we want to kill messages? Or just backlog it, and we can try implement a websocket chat down the road. I can route us a coming soon page if we want to keep it on layout. Or disable 
            it and have a mouseover that says coming soon?
            Notification: I'm not sure where we go with this. Websocket push for likes and friends? Might be more than we want to bite off.

    We had talked about email-confirmation before. I think that's officially backlog for now, but I'll look into doing it as soon as the rest is built out.
